Finding porters and guides in Kathmandu is easy, just go to any local agency they will assist you to organize staff for your purposes. The Sherpa guides usually know the trail, best views and area very well. Doing it yourself is not hard and plane, bus, or jeep tickets from Kathmandu to Lukla are the only thing that you have to organize. You follow a very clear main trail, everybody stays in the same little “towns” with many tea houses enjoying sherpa culture, and it is not necessary to book anything."
